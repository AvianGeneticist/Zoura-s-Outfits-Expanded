	description "This is a fission reactor rod that's been tampered with to be useable without a proper reactor. To be operated, however, it needs a proper, lead-lined rack for storage, so the jury is still out on how efficient one of these is, exactly."

	description "This enlarged uranium reactor rod is a more efficient energy producer, but is also far more expensive. Its size also makes it far less modular, and also makes it impossible to use as improvised ammunition."

	description "This is, at its core, a lead-lined shelving unit for reactor rods. That said, it provides even small ships with the capability to make use of nuclear power, even if said power is slightly unsafe."
