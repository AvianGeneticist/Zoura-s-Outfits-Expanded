	description "This is a fission reactor rod that has been tampered with to allow it to generate energy without a proper reactor. To do so, however, it needs a lead-lined rack for storage, so the jury is still out on how efficient one of these is, exactly."

	description "This enlarged uranium reactor rod is a more efficient energy producer, but it is also far more expensive than its smaller counterpart. Its size also makes it far less modular, and also makes it impossible to use as improvised ammunition."

	description "This is a lead-lined shelving unit for reactor rods. Its small size allows even light ships to make use of nuclear power, even if the application is - by some peoples' metrics - slightly unsafe."

	description "This is a larger but no-more sophisticated model of reactor rack for storing and protecting fission reactor rods."
