	description `The "Fightershot" turret was developed by an independent weapons firm on New China who sought to create a cheap yet effective starship armament by crowdfunding their research. Although the firm did not meet their funding goals and could not iron out the weapon's flaws, the resulting weapon still has some admirable traits: It is cheap to produce, can be manufactured with easily-sourced materials, and is capable of being fielded by all but the smallest ships. These characteristics make "Fightershot" extremely popular in the Dirt Belt where small pirate vessels are common.`
	description `	As the name implies, the weapon fires a large spread of pellets, covering a substantial area. These pellets are injected with a small amount of hyperspace fuel to give them an explosive bite.`
