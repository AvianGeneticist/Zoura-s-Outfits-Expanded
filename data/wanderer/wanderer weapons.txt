	description "For millenia the Wanderers have based their entire military strategy around the use of the Sunbeam, which has given rise to support weapons such as the Eclipse Rangefinder. This outfit is designed to hold a target at the perfect range where they can be hit by Sunbeam fire, while also keeping them far enough to ensure they cannot strike back with shorter-ranged weapons."
