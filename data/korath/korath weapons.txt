	description "When the Korath first salvaged a ship equipped with gatling guns, they were surprised to say the least. Such a primitive, simple weapon doesn't seem like it would be effective, but it was capable of dealing remarkable damage, especially to a ship with downed shields."
	description `	This "modernized" take on the weapon benefits greatly from the inclusion of Korath technology; a much faster motor doubles the weapon's fire rate, and integrated cooling loops reduce the need for an extensive cooldown period. Though the ammunition stores burn down much faster than the standard gatling gun, the weapon still remains extremely effective.`
	description `	Though the weapon's cooldown period is staunchly reduced due to the cooling loop, it still eventually dumps all of its heat back into the parent ship.`

	description "A complete retooling of the venerable Grab-Strike to make it more functional on the angled ports of Palavret warships. The Trail-Sweep doesn't do nearly as much damage as its turreted brother, but is capable of arcing its shots to hit targets."
