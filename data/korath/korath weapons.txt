	description `When the Korath first salvaged a ship equipped with Gatling Guns, they were astonished at its potency. Originally more interested in its scrap value than anything else, the Exiles ignored the Gatling Gun on their raids until, in an uncommonly perilous fight against human pirates, the weapon was shown to be able to deal remarkable damage - especially to a ship with downed shields.`
	description `	The Korath's reimagining of the Gatling Gun benefits greatly from the inclusion of their technology: improved electronics and a redesigned motor doubles the weapon's fire rate, and integrated cooling loops reduce the need for an extensive cooldown period. Though the ammunition stores burn down much faster than a human Gatling gun, the weapon still remains extremely effective.`
	description `	While the weapon's cooldown period is staunchly reduced due to the cooling loop, it still eventually dumps all of its heat back into the parent ship.`
