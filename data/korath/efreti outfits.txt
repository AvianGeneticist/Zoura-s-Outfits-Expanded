	description `Taking inspiration from the Quarg's powerful and efficient shield generators, these Systems Cores use basic quantum shield technology to optimize the regeneration of a ship's shield matrix, increasing the effectiveness of any shield generator aboard the ship. Additionally, it utilizes Quarg insights in battery technology for an increased battery density compared to standard Systems Cores.`
