	description `The Kor Sestor most commonly rely on their durable hulls rather than their comparatively underdeveloped shield matrices for survivability. This has led to some rather ingenious uses for their otherwise inferior shields, mostly in the form of Reformers: Large devices that heavily alter shield performance to bestow some major benefit onto the craft.`
	description `	This Reformer forces the ship's matrix into a fluted sort of configuration, granting a ship increased heat dissipation at the cost of letting some damage through the shield, especially as the shield depletes.`

	description `	This Reformer uses extremely advanced shield assembly techniques to provide extra space around a ship's hardpoints, offloading some of the ship's weaponry onto the newly created surfaces, resulting in a net increase in armament capacity. Of course, the downside is that the reformation makes shields permeable to damage, especially as they weaken.`

This has led to some rather ingenious uses for their otherwise inferior shields, mostly in the form of Reformers: Large devices that heavily alter shield performance to bestow some major benefit onto the craft.`
	description `	This Reformer works by layering some of a ship's shields inside of its armor, making it much more durable. This does, of course, confer a significant hit to the shields' effectiveness, but also transfers some shield generation over to effective hull repair as well.`
