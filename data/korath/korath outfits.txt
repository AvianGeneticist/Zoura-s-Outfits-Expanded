	description "Like a standard plasma core, this reactor relies on fusion. However, in times of dire speed or energy need, the ship carrying the device can dump hyperspace fuel into the reactor, providing extra medium to fuse before providing a large surge of thrust."

	description "The augmentations made to this Korath reactor allow it to be toggled to a higher gear by dumping extra hyperspace fuel in to fuse, resulting in a far greater level of output. Because the modifications affect the reactor's size so greatly, the Korath don't make a triple variant of this design."

	description "Production vessels are common enough that the Korath Exiles are willing to spend some of their limited resources on optimization. This enormous power plant contains both plasma core chambers and dedicated heat shunts to keep the entire structure running cool."
	description "	Due to the size and sprawl of the power complex, the integrated heat shunts lose effectiveness in the presence of cooling-tampering outfits."
