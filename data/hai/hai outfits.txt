	description "The Vibrissae Shield Buffer is the small option for a hai ship looking to upgrade its shield matrix, boosting a ship's durability significantly. This does, however, come at the cost of requiring more energy to recharge the ship's shield, and generating extra heat while shields are recharging."
	description "Because it must be installed near the exterior of the ship's hull to provide its shield-bolstering abilities, it must replace some of a ship's standard hull armor, and is a bit unwieldly."
