	description "The Vibrissae Shield Buffer is a compact outfit suitable for any Hai captain who wants to upgrade their ship's shield matrix, boosting its durability significantly. This upgrade, however, comes at the cost of requiring more energy to recharge the ship's shield, and generating extra heat while the shields are recharging."
	description "	Because it must be installed near the exterior of the ship's hull to provide its shield-bolstering abilities, it must replace some of a ship's standard hull armor."

	description "While an old technology for the Hai, shield buffers saw a resurgence during the Korath raids when Hai ships had to be rapidly adapted to be able to take on the more technologically advanced ships of the Anatruskor, and have been continuously used in the conflict with the Unfettered. One Pelage shield buffer can improve the base shield matrix of a Shield Beetle by nearly fifteen percent."
