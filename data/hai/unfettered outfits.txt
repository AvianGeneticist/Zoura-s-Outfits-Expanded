	description "In trying to push their fighters' capabilities to the brink, the Unfettered have developed an energy-dense reactor that can provide prodigious amounts of power in a small package. While these high-energy reactors are often too hot to run on their ships normally, this reactor can modulate its performance, allowing it to self-cool to suit a host ship's needs."

	description "The Unfettered's reliance on their Solifuges and the Violin Spider fighters they carry means that they have a vested interest in micromanaging ships to be well-optimized. This cooling system is half the size of the Hai's smallest cooling system, but provides just over half the cooling."
