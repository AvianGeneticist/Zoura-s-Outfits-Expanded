	description `The Unfettered have made a point of tweaking and improving Hai technology for their own uses, and this weapon is a good example of this strategy. Essentially an ionic grenade launcher, this weapon fires Charge Gas canisters fired are under high pressure, making them likely to explode long before they reach their target. By re-engineering the Charge Gas Sprayer into a smaller weapon and cutting out an integrated storage tank, the Unfettered have created a potent fighter weapon out of a system typically reserved for larger ships.`
