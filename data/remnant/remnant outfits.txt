	description "This is a specially designed plate made of the Remnant's composite materials, designed to replace standard hull armor, though the support structures needed end up taking a lot of outfit space."
	description `	Though all Remnant ships use these materials by default, some Remnant captains install extra plates to further augment a ship's regenerative abilities and ramscoop.`

	"scramble resistance" 0.0375
	description "Though the Remnant almost always use more powerful radiothermal generators to run due to their high energy use, some non-combat ships may instead opt for piezoelectric cells. Though not especially powerful, these cells run very cold, and provide substantial resistance to ionization effects."
