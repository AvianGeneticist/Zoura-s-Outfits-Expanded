name "Zoura's Outfits Expanded"
about `This plugin aims to greatly expand outfit variety across all of Endless Sky; at the moment, every subfaction (except for the Quarg, Pug, and Drak) has received at least one outfit, though most have received more than that. Also of note is that care has been made to ensure that outfits are all accessible by at least one means through normal, otherwise-vanilla gameplay (for example, Korath and Gegno outfits can be obtained by looting/capping, Human and Hai outfits via outfitters, et cetera). The mod also features support for Darcy Manoel's Omnis as well, for those who'd like to cheat- I mean, play around with the outfits in an easily accessible environment.
